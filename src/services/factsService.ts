    title: "Honey Never Spoils",
    content: "Archaeologists have found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Honey's low moisture content and acidic pH create an environment where bacteria cannot survive.",

    title: "Your Body Produces Diamond Dust",
    content: "When you move your joints, the pressure changes can cause tiny nitrogen bubbles to form and collapse, creating microscopic diamond crystals that dissolve almost instantly. This is what causes the popping sound.",

    title: "Bananas Are Radioactive",
